# Welcome to DevOops

## Oh! Hey! Didn't expect to see you here

Welcome to my collection of learnings and ramblings. The intent of this project is two fold. First is as a personal reference. I'm very forgetful. Second is to be helpful to anyone else who might have stumbled upon this site. I hope you find something in here that can help you in whatever exciting project you're working on now or next.

If this page has helped you, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stewmore) :coffee:. Regardless, I hope you find something that can help you create amazing things.
