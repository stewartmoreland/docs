Welcome to our guide to building a **Production Ready Spring Boot Configuration for Kubernetes**. This guide encompasses knowledge and experience gained from deploying hundreds of Spring Boot microservices to many Kubernetes environments for multiple clients & application teams over the past 6+ years. We hope to help you on your journey to learning and developing for Kubernetes and to build resilient Spring applications wherever you chose to host your Kubernetes platform.
